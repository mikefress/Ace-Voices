                    That’s why we are inclined to represent BAME, LGBTQI+, people with stories from different walks of life, 
                    and those who find it tough getting into any high barrier of entry industries that require university

                <h4><b>Question: When you say you’re a remote online full service voiceover talent agency, what does that mean exactly?</b><br><br>
                    Answer: It means we are a talent agency representing voiceover talent exclusively without any physical offices to go to! 
                    We believe in 100% remote working online without the costs of rent hanging over us for us to recoup in our pricing to clients. 
                    As for full service, we want to do what it says on the tin to get the script turned into a final mixed track to go on any project. 
                    This includes providing the VO talent, organising the conference call to hear the recording and providing the sound engineer to mix and master the final track. </h4>

                    Answer: As we’re a brand new agency, we need more time and resource into putting together a more comprehensive website with all the info! 
                    We thank you for your patience and in the meantime, we’ll be able to share all the details with you over a quick email with the latest info. </h4>
