                <h4><b>Question: When you say you’re a remote online full service voiceover talent agency, what does that mean exactly?</b><br><br>
                    Answer: It means we are a talent agency representing voiceover talent exclusively without any physical offices to go to! 
                    We believe in 100% remote working online without the costs of rent hanging over us for us to recoup in our pricing to clients. 
                    As for full service, we want to do what it says on the tin to get the script turned into a final mixed track to go on any project. 
                    This includes providing the VO talent, organising the conference call to hear the recording and providing the sound engineer to mix and master the final track. </h4>

                <h4><b>Question: When are your working hours?</b><br><br>
                    Answer: Our working hours are 9am to 5pm Monday to Friday. After hour projects can be discussed.</h4>

                <h4><b>Question: Where are you based? </b><br><br>
                    Answer: We are based in London so any emails sent around the world will need to bear in mind that we are in the GMT timezone.</h4>

            <div class="item">
                <h4><b>Question: So…you have no straight, white middle-aged talent whatsoever?</b><br><br>
                    Answer: Not necessarily! We just want to focus more on everyone else but we’ll have one or two who believe in our cause and fulfil our criteria of being hardworking, open-minded and unique. </h4>

            <div class="item">
                <h4><b>Question: When can we see your talent options, pricing, or ways of working?</b><br><br>
                    Answer: As we’re a brand new agency, we need more time and resource into putting together a more comprehensive website with all the info! 
                    We thank you for your patience and in the meantime, we’ll be able to share all the details with you over a quick email with the latest info. </h4>
